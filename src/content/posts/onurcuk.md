Hello! I am Mehmet Akif ÇİNİCİ, a student preparing to graduate from the computer engineering department this year. My interest in technology has always carried me forward throughout my life, and today I am here to write to share what I have learned and to record my own story on this journey.

In recent years, I have realized that people of our age need to be able to not only write code, but also develop innovative solutions to problems, think interdisciplinary and adapt to the ever-changing world of technology. I am developing myself in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, XR (augmented reality and virtual reality) development, and I am excited to explore the future potential of these areas.

## What I'll Write About

The topics I plan to write about in this blog are:

- **Technology and Future Trends**: Innovations in the world of artificial intelligence, VR/AR and game development.
- **Personal Development and Motivation**: About what I have learned and what I want to develop as I develop both my technical and personal skills.
- **Entertainment and Culture**: My hobbies like anime, manga, and manhwa that I simply enjoy without any deeper purpose. I've probably read over a million webtoons…
- **My Projects**: Software I developed, VR experiences, and experiences I gained from the events I attended.

## My Goal

My goal is to contribute to both myself and those who want to follow me on this journey by sharing what I have learned. Whether you are a computer science major, a tech enthusiast or just a reader, I believe you will find something for yourself here.

Stay curious, stay creative, and remember: 'The future belongs to those who believe in the beauty of their dreams' — but also to those who binge-watch anime at 2 AM. Follow me for more!
